# Documents-Copy-Generator
This Python script provides a simple graphical user interface (GUI) for selecting a source file and making multiple copies of that file while renaming them. It allows you to specify the number of copies you want to create. The script uses the shutil and os libraries for file operations and the tkinter library for creating the user interface.
